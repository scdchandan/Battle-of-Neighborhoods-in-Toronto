# Battle-of-Neighborhoods-in-Toronto
<br>
Suppose a family leaving in Toronto decides to shift to a different neighborhood but is keen to shift to one which is most common to their existing neighborhood. This project exhibits an implemented algorithm to help in such decision-making. The project aims to cluster the neighborhoods in Toronto depending on the nearby top venues, category of venues, and their social media presence. The Foursquare API is leveraged for extracting data to fulfill the aim of the project. All steps including Data cleaning, aggregation, model evaluation are covered.
